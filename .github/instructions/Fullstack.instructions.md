# Fullstack Development Instructions
## General Guidelines
- Whenever making updates to the website, utilize the analyze-website.js analyzer to check for issues through puppeteer.
- Ensure that all changes are compatible with the existing codebase and do not introduce breaking changes.
- Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code.
- Follow best practices for both frontend and backend development.
- Ensure code is modular and reusable.
- Use version control effectively (e.g., Git).
- Write unit tests for critical components.
- Servers used should be both frontend and backend hosted on port 5000 on gunicorn server(with start-prod.sh) for production.
- When developing, all changes made to the api should be made to the main api server running on port 5000, do not make new instances.
- When testing the fronted, use the api server running on port 5000 for api access, and do not create new instances, run the preview server for the webpage on port 3000.
- If there is ever a conflict when you attempt to run something on a port, do not create a new instance, instead, stop the existing process using that port.
- After every change, ensure that no functionality is broken and that the application runs smoothly.
- The website is hosted by cloudflare through github pages, so ensure that any changes made to the website are compatible with cloudflare's requirements, as well as the requirements of github pages, and the gunicorn and redis servers.
## Security
- Sanitize and validate all user inputs to prevent XSS and SQL injection attacks.
- Use HTTPS for all communications.
- Use environment variables for sensitive information (e.g., API keys, database credentials).
- Ensure that the code is compatible with the latest stable versions of libraries and frameworks.
## Coding Standards
- Use consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for classes).
- Use indentation and spacing consistently (2 spaces for JavaScript, 4 spaces for Python).
- Use semicolons at the end of statements in JavaScript.
- Keep the codebase clean and organized, with a clear directory structure.
## Code Quality
- Use linters and formatters (e.g., ESLint, Prettier) to maintain code quality.
- Write meaningful commit messages.
- Use code reviews to ensure quality and share knowledge.
- Document code with comments and README files.
## Frontend Development
- Use modern frameworks (e.g., React, Vue, Angular).
- Ensure responsive design and cross-browser compatibility.
- Optimize for performance and accessibility.
- Use state management libraries (e.g., Redux, Vuex) where appropriate.
- Follow a consistent styling approach (e.g., CSS-in-JS, SASS).
- The design for the website is intended to be simple, dark mode, with a focus on usability and feature richness.
- Design for the website should be based on the liquid glass design by Apple in iOS 26. All features should be designed with this in mind, and the design should be simple, dark mode, and focus on usability and feature richness. 
- The website should be designed to be responsive and work well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- All data fields, formatting, and other design elements should be consistent with the liquid glass design and should be thoroughly tested to ensure that they work well on both desktop and mobile devices as well as correctly populate values and correspond to the data in the database.
- Utilize tailwindcss for styling, ensuring that the design is consistent with the liquid glass design and is responsive across devices.
- The design should be dark mode with the liquid glass design in mind, with a focus on usability and feature richness.
- Ensure that the design is visually appealing and consistent with the liquid glass design, with a focus
